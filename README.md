> The 6 small rectangles along the top should be buttons that when clicked, filter the boxes below. The result being, clicking the button labelled ‘B’ should show only boxes labelled ‘B’ etc. Clicking the button labelled “All” should show all the boxes. After filtering, the visible boxes should follow the same pattern as the design, and there should be no blank spaces where the other boxes were.

> On larger screens the buttons should stretch the full width of the content and be equally spaced.
On smaller screens the buttons should be scrollable horizontally so that all the buttons can be accessed, but the scrollbar should not be visible when not scrolling.

> On page scroll, when the filter buttons reach the top of the screen they should become fixed - as shown in the “fixed.png” image.
The main boxes should be displayed as shown in the “desktop.png” image, with a pattern that would repeat after the 12 blocks, if more were added.
On mobile screens, the boxes should be stacked vertically as shown in the “mobile.png” image. The breakpoint between the mobile and desktop layouts is up to you.

> The exact dimensions of the boxes is not really important, but on mobile the featured boxes should be square and the others should have a 2:1 width:height ratio. On desktop, the boxes should all be square and the featured boxes should be roughly twice the width and height of the other boxes.
